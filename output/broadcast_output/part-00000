be
case
in
academia

used
by

Variations
in
operational
definitions
of
how
to
count
words
can
occur
namely
what
counts
as
word
and
which
words
don't
count
toward
total
However
especially
since
advent
of
widespread
word
processing
there
is
broad
consensus
on
these
operational
definitions
and
hence
bottom
line
integer
result
The
consensus
is
to
accept
text
segmentation
rules
generally
found
in
most
word
processing
software
including
how
word
boundaries
are
determined
which
depends
on
how
word
dividers
are
defined
The
first
trait
of
that
definition
is
that
space
any
of
various
whitespace
characters
such
as
regular
word
space
em
space
or
tab
character
is
word
divider
Usually
hyphen
or
slash
is
too
Different
word
counting
programs
may
give
varying
results
depending
on
text
segmentation
rule
details
and
on
whether
words
outside
main
text
such
as
footnotes
endnotes
or
hidden
text)
are
counted
But
behavior
of
most
major
word
processing
applications
is
broadly
similar
However
during
era
when
school
assignments
were
done
in
handwriting
or
with
typewriters
rules
for
these
definitions
often
differed
from
todays
consensus
Most
importantly
many
students
were
drilled
on
rule
that
certain
words
don't
count
usually
articles
namely
but
sometimes
also
others
such
as
conjunctions
for
example
and
or
but
and
some
prepositions
usually
to
of
Hyphenated
permanent
compounds
such
as
follow
up
noun
or
long
term
adjective
were
counted
as
one
word
To
